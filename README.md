-ðŸ’¡ "People confuse programming with coding.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coding is to programming, what typing is to writing.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Writing, is something that envolves mental effort.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same way, programs are built on ideas."<br />
